The readme is the documentation and main application.

It should document and define the cli application and build steps.

A successful `notebook` program could find uses outside of its
interactive state as programs, documentation, or tests.
`pidgy` programming includes a `click` command-line 
`application` to weave `notebook`s to other forms and tangle `notebook`s as source code.

    def document(to, files):
The `document` command is an opinionated wrapper that 
converts notebooks to formatted python programs
and readable documents.

        exporter = nbconvert.get_exporter(to)
It uses the `nbconvert` library that transforms the `nbformat` into other projections.

        if to in _CODE_FORMATS: 
`pidgy` introduces a new opinion to the notebook where
the input defines the output.
In literate programming terms, 
we tangle the input and weave the output.
The decoupling of the input & output means that proper
python code maybe extracted from the `input`.  `pidgy`
includes `‚¨õÔ∏è and isort` community conventions 
for formatting python to abide python styling guides.

            exporter = PythonExporter()
        else:
With `pidgy`, we may consider a cell output to be the intended
`display` set forth by an author.
A string opinion `pidgy` documents is that the `input`
is excluded from resulting document, where as typical
approaches view all code as essential or not essential.
            
            exporter = exporter(exclude_input=True)
