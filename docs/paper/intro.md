# Introduction

What problems did literate programming solve:

- Literacy and readability take precedence over coding excellence.
- Non-programmers can contribute.

What problems am I solving.

- A markdown python literate program hybrid. python is an idiomatic programming
  language with the intent of being a computer programming (language) for
  everyone.
- Interleaving markdown and code narrative.
- A more diff friendly literate programming source code.
- Add interactivity to the literate programming process.

<!--The introduction should be written as a stand alone essay.-->

"[Literate programming]" is a paper published by [Donald Knuth] in 1979. It
describes a style of programming that promotes a literary approach to writing
programs as documentation. Literate programs are measured along two dimensions:
literary and computational quality.

[Literate Programming] is alive in places like [Org mode for Emacs],
[RMarkdown], [Jupyter Notebooks], [Doctest], or [Literate Coffeescript].

`pidgy` imagines an adoption of [Literate Programming] as documentation for
data-driven computational narratives.  
`pidgy` implements a literate computing interface for `jupyter` using open
source scientific computing infrastructure.

The outcome of writing `pidgy` programs are readable, reusable, and reproducible
documents.  
`pidgy` natively supports importing markdown and notebooks as source code.

Modern computing has different pieces of software infrastructure than were
available
