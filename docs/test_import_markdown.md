# Reusing markdown documents as code.

    import pidgy

In `pidgy`, `markdown` documents are transformed into programs that can be
imported. This document tests that ability.

    try: from . import test_import_markdown
    except: import test_import_markdown
    assert test_import_markdown.__file__.endswith('.md')
