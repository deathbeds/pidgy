`pidgy` has a few components to it:

- It is an interactive [Literate Programming] implementation for interactive computing in `IPython`
- A specification of a _potentially_ more kernel approach for literate programming applied to other languages.
- A complete unit of computable scientific literate. It is written in a literate programming style with the literature as the primary outcome. _Read the `pidgy` paper_.
